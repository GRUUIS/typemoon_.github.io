                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>TYPE-MOON is the brand name used by Japanese game publisher Notes Co., Ltd. for the release of its merchandise Notes by painter Takashi Takeuchi, while the social name comes from the work Notes by writer Mushroo Nasu.
                TYPE-MOON was originally a doujin club, led by Takashi Takeuchi and Mushuro Naisu. Their first notable work was the Realm of Emptiness, which Naisu regularly serialized on his and Takeuchi's personal website, Takashi Bamboo, from October 1998 to May 1999.
                TYPE-MOON's real success was the Winter 2000 Comic Market release of Yuki Hime, with TYPE-MOON's unique world view and the feeling of life and death to attract countless players.</p>
                <p>In 2003, Takeuchi and Naisu established Notes LTD., and in April of the same year, after releasing a moonbox of published works from the past to the present (except Melty Blood) under the fan-name, disbanded the fan club TYPE-MOON and positioned it as a commercial brand under Notes LTD.</p>
                <p>On January 30, 2004, Notes released their first commercially corporatized game Fate/stay night, and Fate/stay night's Fate route story was animated in January 2006.</p>
                <p>Their success has been hailed as one of the "Three Wonders of Doujin" in Japan, along with the Oriental Project and the Chilling Cicada, and has had considerable influence, allowing more people to devote themselves to doujin creation.</p>
